# d6geodata
This is a package with the intention to help you find the geodata we have so far in our d6 lab.

It is currently not working properly!

In the future it will help you to get an overview of the data with all information you need and will help you to access the data at least with a path to the data.

functions so far:

build_meta_file: helps to create a meta data file
render_geodata: creates a html document that can be uploaded to github to show which geodata we have so far. Works only from the GeoData Project!
